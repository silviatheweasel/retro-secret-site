# About the Project

This is a responsive front-end project of an e-commerce jewelry website modelled on my own website built on a commercial plarform. It is built with React JS and loads data from a mock API service. 
- It allows users to browse throught the products by category and add them to the cart. 
- It allows users to adjust the quantity in the cart or delete the products.
- It calculates the shipping cost based on which shipping service is chosen and whether the free shipping limit is reached.

## Built with
